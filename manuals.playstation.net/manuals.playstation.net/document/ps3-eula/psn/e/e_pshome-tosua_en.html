 			<p class="bold">ANY AND ALL OF YOUR ACTIVITY AND COMMUNICATION IN PlayStation®Home MAY BE MONITORED AND RECORDED WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE. THE DATA COLLECTED MAY BE USED TO ENSURE YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY BE PASSED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU CONSENT TO THIS. FURTHER DETAILS BELOW.</p>
    <h2>PlayStation®Home Terms of Use</h2>
    <p>Thank you for your interest in PlayStation®Home. Participation in PlayStation®Home is subject to the terms of this agreement (“Terms of Use”) which forms a binding contract between you and PlayStation Network Europe Limited of 10 Great Marlborough Street, London, W1F 7LP (“us”, “we”).  The PlayStation®Network Terms of Service and User Agreement (“Terms of Service”) also apply.  The Terms of Service are available at <a href="http://network.eu.playstation.com/tosua/index.html">http://network.eu.playstation.com/tosua/index.html</a>.  PlayStation®Home may not be available, or may not be supported, in some countries and some languages. www.eu.playstation.com/terms</p>
<ol>
    	<li>You must be 16 years or older and a PSN Account Holder to participate in PlayStation®Home.</li>
    	<li>You must at all times act lawfully and with respect towards other users.  We are not responsible for the behaviour of other users but please let us know if you become aware of any unlawful or inappropriate behaviour in PlayStation®Home. </li>
    	<li>PlayStation®Home is in beta.  From time to time during the beta we may modify PlayStation®Home and related content, services and software automatically and without notice. Modifications may cause loss of data or content and loss of function or utility.  You hereby authorise us to make all such modifications and agree that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we are not liable for any loss of data, content, function or utility.</li>
    	<li>PlayStation®Home may include tools, such as the ability to communicate with other users and to post, stream or transmit pictures, photographs, game-related materials, music, home video content and other information in some areas of PlayStation®Home (“User Material”). <br>
<br>
When using these tools, you must comply with the Terms of Service.  In particular, do not use offensive or vulgar language, images, or sounds in any area of PlayStation®Home or in any communication to other users.  This includes speech that is racially, ethnically, or religiously offensive, defamation, threats, bullying and stalking.  Also, do not use the community tools to access, use or distribute any content or material that you know or should have known to be infringing or pirated, to abuse or harass other users, or to conduct any activities that violate any applicable laws.  PlayStation®Home is an international environment which enables you to communicate with individuals in your own and other countries.  Information provided by you in PlayStation®Home may be viewed by individuals in countries that may not offer the same protection for personal data as is provided in your country.<br>
<br>
We may provide you with content to use in the creation of User Material.  User Material created by you will belong to you, although any content provided by us will still belong to us or our licensors as explained in the Terms of Service.<br>
<br>
You authorise us, our affiliated companies and other PSN users, to use, distribute, copy, modify, display, and publish your User Material throughout PSN and other associated services.  You also authorise us and our affiliated companies, without payment to you, to license, sell and otherwise commercially exploit your User Material (for example, selling subscriptions to access User Material and/or receiving advertising revenue related to User Material), and to use your User Material in the promotion of PlayStation products and services.  You must not commercially exploit User Material without our consent.  You waive any moral rights you may have in your User Material.  By posting, streaming or transmitting User Material you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to use, post, stream and transmit such User Material and to grant the rights set out in this paragraph.
</li>
    	<li>You agree that your suggestions for improvements, enhancements and other changes to PlayStation®Home, and our other products and services, may be implemented by us, in whole or in part, without any payment or other compensation to you or anyone else. If your suggestions are not your own original ideas, please do not submit them.</li>
    	<li>We cannot monitor the whole of PlayStation®Home and make no commitment to do so.  However, we reserve the right in our sole discretion, to monitor and record your online activity and communication throughout PlayStation®Home (including in public spaces, club houses and apartments) and to remove any content from PlayStation®Home at our sole discretion, all without further notice. Any data received in this way, including the contents of your voice and text communications, the time and location of your activities, and your online ID and IP address may be processed to ensure your compliance with the Terms of Use, the Terms of Service and applicable laws and may be passed to competent authorities.  By accepting these Terms of Use, you expressly consent to this for the duration of your use of PlayStation®Home and for such additional period as it may be necessary for us to process your personal data.  If you experience any unacceptable or inappropriate behaviour while in PlayStation®Home or wish to report any other breach of the Terms of Service or Terms of Use, please let us know using PlayStation®Home’s grief reporting facility. </li>
    	<li>We reserve the right to suspend or cancel PlayStation®Home or your access to it at any time in our absolute discretion. If we believe that you are in breach of any of these Terms of Use or any other relevant terms, we may terminate your participation in PlayStation®Home and/or your PSN account without paying any compensation to you. </li>
    	<li>To the extent permitted by applicable law, these Terms of Use shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of England and the contract between you and us shall be deemed to have been formed and performed in England. We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms of Use to any of our affiliates and sub-contractors without your consent provided that such assignment does not adversely affect your rights under these Terms of Use.  </li>
