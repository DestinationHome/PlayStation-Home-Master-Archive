Two different types of game can be created via the "Social > Game Launching" menu in the Menu Screen:

<BULLET>Supported Games
<BULLET>Other Games

Supported games are those that have full Game Launching support and a custom settings screen on which you choose the options for them.  Everyone involved will launch into the same supported game together with the chosen options.

Other games have more limited options and when launched each person will be taken individually to the title screen for that game.

In both cases use [UP] [DOWN] [LEFT] [RIGHT] to navigate around the options screen and [CROSS] to make changes.  If there is more than one screen of options then [L1] and [R1] will change between them.  When you are happy with the options press [TRIANGLE] to create the game.
