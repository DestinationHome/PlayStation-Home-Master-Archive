Avatar status is the overall mood that you want your character to display.  It is represented by an icon and status text in the character label.

In addition certain statuses have associated facial expressions and idle animations.  You can change status from the emote menu by pressing [R1], choosing "Status" and then selecting one from the list with [CROSS] or [RIGHT].
