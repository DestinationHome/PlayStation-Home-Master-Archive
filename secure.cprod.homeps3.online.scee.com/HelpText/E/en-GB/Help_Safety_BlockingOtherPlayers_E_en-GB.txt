There are a number of options for controlling the communication you receive from other players in PlayStation®Home:

<BULLET>Mute: Disable voice communication from this player for this session.
<BULLET>Ignore: Disable all communication (both voice and text) from this player for this session.
<BULLET>Block: Add this player to your PlayStation®Network block list.  This will permanently disable all communication (both text and voice) from the player until you un-block them.

Mute is available from the Chat Log Voice tab.
