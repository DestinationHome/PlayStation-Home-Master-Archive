<LARGE>What are clubs?

A club is a group of people who share a common interest like games, movies or music.  You can search for an existing club to join or create a new one.  A club can have up to 32 members and you can be in up to 5 clubs at the same time.  There are many benefits to creating or joining a club:

<LARGE>How do I create a club?

Clubs are created by a club leader who is then responsible for managing it.  You can only be the leader of one club at a time.  It is free to join a club but costs <CLUB_PRICE> to create your own.  When you are ready to create your club press [CROSS] to continue and you will be taken to the PlayStation®Store checkout page.  Once you have paid for your club you will be able to choose a club name and tag.

This payment entitles you to set up a Club. At the moment there is no ongoing charge for running a Club but, in the future, we will introduce a fee (to be determined), which will be due every 30 days. Before introducing a recurring fee, we will give you not less than 90 days prior notice. If you do not wish to pay the fee at any time, you do not have to, but you will lose your entitlement to run the Club and we may delete your Club entirely. As the person who set up the Club, you will be the Club Leader. As Leader, you can invite up to 31 other users to join your Club, and appoint up to four of them as sub-leaders. You can only lead one club at a time. However, you can join up to five clubs (leading one, and joining four others). You cannot transfer leadership of your Club to anyone else. If you wish to disband your Club at any time, you may do so by following the instructions in the PlayStation®Home Manual. Once a Club is set up its name cannot be changed and, if you disband your Club, you will not be able to reuse its name. Please see the PlayStation®Home Manual for more information pertaining to Clubs and Club membership.[#Legal]
