To see which clubs you are associated with open the Menu Screen and select "Social > Clubs > My Clubs".  This screen lists all of the clubs you own or are a member of (if you are the leader of a club this is indicated by a crown icon next to the name).  To see the options for a club select it and press [CROSS].

For each club you have options for the "Clubhouse", "Members" and "Club Profile".  If you are the leader of a club you also have additional admin options.

If you are a normal member of a club you are able to "Leave Club".  The leader of a club may not leave it, instead they must use the admin controls to "Disband" the club.
