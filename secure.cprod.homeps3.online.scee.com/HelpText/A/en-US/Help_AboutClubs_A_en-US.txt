Joining a Club gives you access to your Club's very own Clubhouse and chat channel. You can chat to other members of your Club or meet up with them in the Clubhouse and check for updates. If there's not a Club of your liking why not create your own? You can invite other users, choose and decorate the Clubhouse and leave bulletins on the Bulletin Board. There's a wide variety of Clubhouses available so there'll always be one to fit your Club.
