Voice chat is a method of communicating with other players using voice through a microphone.  Before attempting voice chat your microphone settings can be checked by opening the Menu Screen and choosing "Options > Audio > Microphone Settings".  Once your microphone is correctly configured press and hold [R2] to speak to all players in your current voice channel.

The Local voice channel is available in Personal Spaces and Clubhouses.  Groups, Clubs and Activities also have their own voice channels.  All of these channels are managed from the Voice tab of the Chat Log:
