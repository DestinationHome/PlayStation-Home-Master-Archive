Open the Menu Screen and select "Options > Cache".

This function allows you to change how PlayStation®Home uses the HDD to store information:

<BULLET>Change Cache Size: Changes how much HDD space is used by PlayStation®Home.  Options are available for 3GB, 5GB, 8GB and 12 GB.  Increasing the size of your cache reduces the chances of needing to re-download anything as you use PlayStation®Home.
<BULLET>Clear Cache: Clears the hard disk cache of all information that has been downloaded.
