This payment entitles you to set up a Club. As the person who set up the Club, you will be the Club Leader. As Leader, you can invite up to 31 other users to join your Club, and appoint up to four of them as sub-leaders. You can only lead one club at a time. However, you can join up to five clubs (leading one, and joining four others). You cannot transfer leadership of your Club to anyone else. If you wish to disband your Club at any time, you may do so by following the instructions in the PlayStation®Home Manual. Once a Club is set up its name cannot be changed and, if you disband your Club, you will not be able to reuse its name. Please see the PlayStation®Home Manual for more information pertaining to Clubs and Club membership.[#Legal]
